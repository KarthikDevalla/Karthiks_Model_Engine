# Karthiks_Model_Engine
To use the engine have the onedata.rar file extracted and placed in the root folder of your IDE and also Karthiks_Model_Engine.py in the same place.
Now go to your preferred IDE and type "import Karthiks_Model_Engine"
and then it'll take you through. Hope it helps. Thank you.
