# Karthiks_Model_Engine
The engine is a small prototype in removing human interference in supervised learning (Automating supervised learning). It is still developing, you can check out the progress .
To use the engine have the onedata.rar file extracted and placed in the root folder of your IDE and also Karthiks_Model_Engine.py in the same place.(PS: make sure the data is cleaned before loading , it can only take care of NaN rows) it will be taken care in the future.
Now go to your preferred IDE and type "import Karthiks_Model_Engine" . When it asks for independent and dependent values, just give the name of the column exactly as it is displayed in the dataset seperating them with ','.
And then it'll take you through. Hope it helps.PLEASE CITE US IF THIS IS HELPFUL. Thank you. For suggestions please mail at ihatecoding666@gmail.com
