# Karthiks_Model_Engine
The engine is a small prototype in removing human interference in supervised learning. It is still developing, you can check out the progress .
To use the engine have the onedata.rar file extracted and placed in the root folder of your IDE and also Karthiks_Model_Engine.py in the same place.(PS: make sure the data is cleaned before loading , it can only take care of NaN rows) it will be taken care in the future.
Now go to your preferred IDE and type "import Karthiks_Model_Engine"
and then it'll take you through. Hope it helps. Thank you.
