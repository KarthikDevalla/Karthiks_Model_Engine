A Python package  is a small prototype in removing human interference in supervised learning (Automating supervised learning).

## Installation
 ```pip install KarthiksModelEngine```
 
## Usage
To use the engine make sure the data is cleaned before loading, it can only take care of NaN rows. This will be taken care in the future.
Use your preferred IDE and type the following.

 ```from fluid.domain import Karthiks_Model_Engine ```

When it asks for independent and dependent values, give the name of the column exactly as it is displayed in the dataset seperating them with ','. 
And then it will take you through.
